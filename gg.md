# Games as a research tool

\usebackgroundtemplate{

## Games as a research tool 

* Almost every Game AI paper begins with something along these lines: 
* "Games have/can be used for Artificial Intelligence Research"
    * Because games are:
        * Fun (?!)
        * Provide nice abstractions of real world problems
        * Are universally accepted
        * Easy to compare with other researchers' AIs/agents

* Let's have an overview of the modern history of game research

## Zermelo
\columnsbegin
\column{.6\textwidth}


* First important result by \emph{Ernst Zermelo, 1913}
* Use the game of Chess as an abstraction 
* Kickstarts game theory - of course no real computers
* "Given that a player (say White) is in `a winning position', how long does it take for White to force a win?"
* Wikipedia cites the correct papers, has the definitions mixed-up with ...

## Von Neumann 
\columnsbegin
\column{.6\textwidth}


* Modern tools actually invented in \emph{John von Neumann, 1944} or possibly \emph{1928}
* Backwards Induction
* You must have heard it as "MinMax" - again, no real computers at the time
* Poker and bluffing are discussed as well

## Turing

\columnsbegin
\column{.6\textwidth}


* Most modern additions to min-max pioneered by \emph{Alan Turing, 1953} 
* Learning, look-aheads, evaluation functions
* Almost every modern method was at least imagined
* But machines still not capable of beating men

## From theory to practice

* From this point onwards, there was a race
* Fundamentally asking the question
* "Can we use computers to actually do what was conceptualised in theory"
    * i.e., can we create (at least) human competitive machines
        * Chess - \emph{IBM Deep Blue, 1996}
        * Head's Up Holdem (Poker) \emph{University of Alberta, 2015}
        * Go \emph{Deep Mind, soon} - apparently Japanese competitor? 
* 50-60 years


## Where did all this research get us? 

* Most classic games will be/are solved
* But what does it mean for Artificial Intelligence?
    * Narrow approaches for building narrow Systems
          * Chess
    * General approaches for building narrow systems
          * Backgammon, Poker, \emph{Maybe} GO 
    * \emph{ narrow approaches for building general systems}
          * Nothing
# Current state of the art

## Enter competitions
* Implicitly one can think of these "races to the top" as competitions
* In the case of go you even had 
* Competitions are the most anti-intellectual thing you can do
    * Adoloscent/childish idea of "I can run faster than you"
      * When it comes to algorithms, it's mostly "My dad is stronger than your dad"
* But there must be some value, somewhere
* In fact, the most common sci-fi game design must be "war of resources"
* But you need some way to measure progress!!!


# Competitions

## Some modern AI competitions

\includegraphics[width = 1.0\textwidth]{figures/narrow.png}

## Some videos
 
## Too narrow

* Some people have plenty of time


# Current state of the (game) AI art

## State of the Art in Game AI


* Some form of lookahead (MCTS) 
* Coupled with premature stopping (A value function)
* Some ability to do fast lookaheads (A policy)
* System seeded from Games


## General Game Playing

## General Video Game Playing Competition (I)

\includegraphics[width = 1.0\textwidth]{figures/general.png}

## General Video Game Playing Competition (II)

## The problem with the Model

## Characteristics of a good competition
* Competitions can be thought of as a formalisation of "Games as Benchmarks"
  * A good looking website
  * Instant gratification
      * A "competition slave"
        * Only real requirement!

## What about generation? 

* Some people actually care about the games themselves
* Procedural content generation
* Turing competitions

## What about believable characters

* Some people care about this too!
* Insane!


## Text
* My interest in in Role Playing Games
* ...or text adventures
* Some new benchmarks but not competitions


# The future of competitions

## Where to from here? 

* Need better benchmarks
* Benchmarks that a machine can solve
  * Without getting into the trap of "General Approaches for Narrow Systems"
  * Models must go away


## Thank you!
